# 🧠 Algorithm Visualizer

A **C++ Static Project** to visually demonstrate classic **algorithms and data structures** including:

- 🔢 Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick)
- 🔍 Searching Algorithms (Linear, Binary)
- 🌐 Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS)
- 🌳 Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations (Insert, Delete, Search, Traversals)

Built using **C++17+ (recommended C++20)** and designed to run smoothly in **Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVC)** on Windows.
