A **C++ Static Project** to visually demonstrate classic **algorithms and data structures** including:

- 🔢 Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge)
- 🌐 Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS)
- 🌳 Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations (Insert, Delete, Search, Traversals)

Built using **C++17+ (recommended C++20)** and designed to run smoothly in **Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVC)** on Windows.

---

## Features

- 📊 **Visual Simulation** of common algorithms
- 💡 Clear and interactive design for educational purposes
- 🎓 Great for learning data structures and algorithm behavior
- 💻 Minimal dependencies – pure C++ graphics
- ⚙️ Easily extensible for other algorithms

---

## Requirements

- **Microsoft Visual Studio 2019/2022**
- **C++17 or C++20 standard**
- Windows OS
