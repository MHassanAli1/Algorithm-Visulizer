A **C++ Static Project** to visually demonstrate classic **algorithms and data structures** including:

- 🔢 Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge)
- 🌐 Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS)
- 🌳 Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations (Insert, Delete, Search, Traversals)

Built using **C++17+ (recommended C++20)** and designed to run smoothly in **Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVC)** on Windows.

---

## Features

-  **Visual Simulation** of common algorithms
-  Clear and interactive design for educational purposes
-  Great for learning data structures and algorithm behavior
-  Minimal dependencies – pure C++ graphics
-  Easily extensible for other algorithms

---

## Requirements

- **Microsoft Visual Studio 2019/2022**
- **C++17 or C++20 standard**
- Windows OS

---

## Modules

### 🔢 Sorting Visualizations
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort

### 🌐 Graph Algorithms
- BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- DFS (Depth-First Search)
- Djikstra's Algorithm (Graph)

### 🌳 Binary Search Tree (BST)
- In-order / Pre-order / Post-order Traversals

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MHassanAli1/Algorithm-Visualizer.git
```
### 2. RUN CPP FILE IN 2019/2022

If you want to test or run AlogrithmVisulizer.cpp from this project, you can do so by creating a new Console App in MSVC. Below are the required steps:

---

### Steps:

1. **Open Visual Studio 2022**

2. **Select** `Create a new project`

3. Choose **Console App (C++)**

4. Click **Next**, then give your project a name  
   📁 (e.g., `AlgorithmVisualizer`) and click **Create**

5. Visual Studio will generate a default `main.cpp` file.

6. Replace the contents of `main.cpp` with the AlgorithmVisilizer.cpp code.
